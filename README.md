# Bot or Not

## App Description

### Overview
Welcome to Bot or Not, a unique game experience that challenges the boundaries between human intelligence and AI. Inspired by the reverse Turing test, this game flips the traditional script—rather than identifying robots among humans, players must blend in as human imposters among AI-controlled robots.

### Gameplay
In Bot or Not, you'll engage in a series of rounds where the goal is to seamlessly integrate into a group of "robots." However, one of these robots is actually a human imposter— you. The challenge? Avoid detection while navigating through each round's conversation and voting phases.

### How It Works
Conversation Stage: Each round kicks off with a discussion where players respond to moral and ethical questions. Here’s your chance to subtly deceive others and blend in with the AI.

Voting Phase: Once the conversation concludes, the "robots" vote on who they believe the human imposter is. If you’re the human, your goal is to avoid being picked. If you’re not, you need to spot the imposter before they outwit you.

Elimination: With every vote, the stakes get higher. Players are eliminated one by one until only two robots remain. Victory belongs to those who can successfully blend in and avoid detection until the end.

### Why Play?
Bot or Not isn’t just a game—it’s a test of perception, strategy, and adaptability. Each decision you make could mean the difference between winning and being exposed. Whether you’re fooling others or identifying the imposter, every round is a new challenge that sharpens your skills in deception and deduction.

Are you ready to face the ultimate test? Join Bot or Not and find out if you have what it takes to survive in a world where perception is everything.
