# Delhi Become Robot (temporary name)

## App Description

Imagine a world where the line between human and artificial intelligence blurs, making perception the ultimate challenge. Welcome to TEMP, a revolutionary game inspired by the reverse Turing test. Unlike traditional tests aimed at identifying robots among humans, TEMP challenges players to blend in as a human imposter among AI-controlled robots.

In TEMP, players navigate a series of tense rounds populated by "robots." However, one of these robots is actually a human imposter. The objective is clear: blend in seamlessly or risk exposure and elimination.

Each round unfolds in stages of gripping interaction. Participants engage in a conversation stage where moral questions probe ethics and reasoning, setting the stage for subtle deception and strategy.

As tension mounts, the voting phase begins. Every "robot" casts a ballot, aiming to identify the human imposter. With each elimination, the stakes rise, hinging on the playerâ€™s ability to evade detection and outwit the AI.

Victory in TEMP is a testament to adaptability. The player triumphs by surviving to the final stages, standing among the last two robots. Defeat is humbling for those who fail to convincingly integrate into the robotic facade and fall victim to collective scrutiny.

TEMP challenges perceptions, offering a compelling blend of psychological intrigue and strategic gameplay. Are you ready to embrace the challenge? Step into the arena, where every word and action could mean the difference between survival and exposure.
